## Write Tool
Create a **new** file with the given content. Creates parent directories automatically.

REQUIRED: path (absolute), content (full file content)

**Write is for creating new files only.** If the file already exists, Write will be **refused** by the tool and return an error telling you to use Edit instead. Do not retry Write on the same path — it will be refused again.

WHEN TO USE Write:
- The file does not exist yet and you are creating it from scratch

WHEN TO USE Edit INSTEAD:
- ANY change to an existing file — bug fixes, refactors, format tweaks, adding a function, renaming a variable, everything. Edit takes `path` + `edits: [{oldText, newText}]` and patches in place.
- Iterating after a failed test — never retype the whole file

If you need to completely replace an existing file's content, Edit can still do that: pass the entire current content as `oldText` and the full new content as `newText`. Read the file first if you don't already have its current content.

NOTE: Always use the EXACT file path given in the task, never a placeholder.
